# Let's consider the following infinite sequence:
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 12, 7, 10, 8, 9, ...
# The 0th element is 0 and the 1st element is 1.
# The successive elements are defined recursively.
# Each of them is the sum of the separate digits of the two previous elements.
# Write a function:
# def solution(N)
# that, given an integer N, returns the N-th element of the above sequence.
# Examples: 1. Given N = 2, the function should return 1.
# 2. Given N = 6, the function should return 8.
# 3. Given N = 10, the function should return 10.
# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
# â€¢ N is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000].
